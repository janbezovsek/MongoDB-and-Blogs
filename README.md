# Blog APP

This is a full stack application (MERN) with authentication functionalities (register and login/logout), saving user's data and blog posts into MongoDB database and using GNews API's for searching and browsing the worldwide news. This app also aplies responsive design principles so that it can be used on multiple devices. We have to create an account for both the MongoDB and GNews. For testing our API endpoints we have used a tool called Postman. For the back-end we used the same logic as in our's Nodejs-MongoDB-Security-features- project with some modifications.
